### Cross-language testing-gap audit

Compare this port's test suite against the other languages' and either close each
difference or record it in `AGENTS.md` as deliberate. Out of scope for the work
that prompted it; tracked here so it is not lost.

Prompted by a concrete miss: `sindri-java`'s golden snapshot never exercised the
dynamic-route regex path, so a framework regex-format change rode through a
dependency bump silently, while `sindri-ts` caught the equivalent change at once
([sindri-java#54](https://github.com/valkyrjaio/sindri-java/pull/54)). Only that
single gap was checked across ports — nobody has compared the suites broadly.

What to look for:

- Behavior a sibling port asserts that this one does not.
- An assertion pinned to a fragment where a sibling pins the whole value — a
  fragment survives the framing around it changing, which is exactly how the miss
  above happened.
- A generator, adapter, or component carrying snapshot/branch coverage on one
  side and none here.
- Test tooling that differs: what the static analyzers and formatters actually
  cover, and whether the test tree is inside or outside that scope.

Not every difference is a defect — some are forced by the language. Read the
per-language notes in `AGENTS.md` before "aligning" anything; the dynamic route
regex framing is the worked example (PHP must keep its PCRE delimiters, every
other port must not).

Known starting point: the port is a proof of concept and `http/routing` is still
empty, so this is mostly forward-looking — the goal is that routing lands already
carrying the tests the other ports have, rather than needing an audit afterwards.

### High priority — name test fixtures `fixtures`, not `classes`

**Cross-language change — mirror this in every port (Java, PHP, Python,
TypeScript) so the test trees stay 1:1.** Reusable test doubles/sample types live
under a `fixtures` package/dir, **not** `classes`. "Fixtures" is the widely-
understood term; "classes" is generic and reads oddly next to `unit`/`functional`
(and "classes" is an odd word in Go anyway). Go is not ported yet, so build it
this way from the start (no rename needed): put reusable doubles under a
`fixtures` test package, never `classes`.

### VLID — cross-language parity

**Cross-language change — mirror in every port (Java, PHP, Python, TypeScript).**
VLID (`Type/Vlid`) is PHP-only today; port it here (code + tests). It is the source
of the queue envelope `id` (a **VLID V1** — the longest, most-random version). Lock
cross-language parity:

- Port `Type/Vlid`, then add a conformance test: generate a VLID for **each version
  V1–V4** from a **fixed input timestamp**.
- Assert this port produces a byte-identical **non-random portion** vs the PHP
  fixture — the encoded **microsecond timestamp** and the **version digit at
  position 14** must match exactly. The random bits differ by design; exclude them.
- This gate prevents timestamp-encoding / version-digit-placement drift from
  silently breaking cross-language `id` interop.
